# Recifacil

A Web System that has the intention to help the donation and the collection of recycling materials in my city, Recife.

But how it works?<br>
Basically the user will log in and he will be able to make a request, this request will be analyzed and sent to the recycling center that will provide ways to collect that item and then Close the request.

What I did was create 2 Systems that 'talk' to each other. One for the donator and another one for the recycling center.

The idea of this project is to be an app (updates coming soon)
This Project will be passed to the MVC pattern using the framework Laravel soon.
